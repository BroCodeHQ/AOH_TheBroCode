## Project Title: 
WonderTales: Generative AI Storytelling for Children

## Problem Statement:
Many parents and teachers struggle to find engaging and educational content to teach moral values to children.

## Solution Overview:
Develop an AI-powered story generator that creates interactive and educational stories for children. This tool will allow parents and teachers to input characters, values, and moral lessons, and generate customized stories. Additionally, it will involve children in the storytelling process by letting them choose the direction of the story.

## Key Features:
- Character and Value Input:
  - Allow parents and teachers to input two characters and specify the values or moral lessons they want to teach.
  - Provide options for selecting themes and settings for the story.
- AI Story Generation:
  - Utilize prompt engineering and generative AI techniques to create story scripts based on the input provided.
  - Ensure the stories are age-appropriate, engaging, and aligned with the specified values.
- Interactive Storytelling:
  - Implement two user flows:
    - Parent/Teacher Flow: Generate a video story based on the input, which can be shown to children as a teaching aid.
    - Child Involvement Flow: Allow children to participate in the storytelling process by making decisions that shape the narrative.
  - Provide options for voice or text input for children to decide the direction of the story.
- Visual Presentation:
  - Create visually appealing animations or illustrations to accompany the story scripts.
  - Ensure accessibility by including voiceover narration and text overlays for children who prefer reading along.
Feedback and Iteration:
Incorporate feedback mechanisms for parents, teachers, and children to provide input on the generated stories.

## Impact:
- Empower parents and teachers with a valuable tool for teaching moral values and fostering creativity in children.
- Enhance children's learning experience by engaging them in interactive storytelling activities.
- Promote positive social and emotional development in children through the reinforcement of moral lessons.
